# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at segmenting customers of an online retail company into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, we can identify patterns and insights that will inform targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in customer data.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implements K-means and hierarchical clustering for customer segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Employs PCA to reduce the complexity of the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Presents findings through clear and informative visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for the project.
- `results/`: Outputs from the analysis, including visualizations and model results.
